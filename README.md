This is a part of Assignment 2 of Forward Kinematics to write the code in Python for the question number 5, 6 and 7

Write python functions that computes the forward kinematics using product of exponential f5.	Write python functions that computes the forward kinematics using product of exponential formula in spatial and body frame.

Verify that the product of exponential formula in spatial and body frame provides the same results. Generate some (3-4) random joint angles and verify that both functions generate same output.

Verify using intuition that the forward kinematics formulas provide expected result. Test functions with 4 different sets of joint angles for which you can visualize what should be the solution and verify that the forward kinematics formulas provide the expected result.
